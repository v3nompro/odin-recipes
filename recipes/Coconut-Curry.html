    <h1> Coconut Curry Haddock    </h1>
    <p>Don't you love one-pot recipes? I love making them. As much as I love to cook, 
        not having a big mess makes me very happy. The curry blend smelled so good and the haddock took on the flavors perfectly!
         Thanks again, City Fish! This is also a 30-minute meal and a paleo dish! Keep it healthy...</p>

         <ul>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> </p> 
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large pot until very hot. Add haddock; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side.
                 Add red bell pepper, shallot, and garlic; cook and stir until shallot softens, about 3 minutes.
             </li>
             <p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
             <li>
                Pour coconut milk into the pot. Whisk in curry paste, curry powder, coriander, and turmeric. 
                Reduce heat; simmer until coconut milk is reduced by 1/4, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in spinach and edamame.
                 Cook until spinach is wilted and edamame is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle green onions over curry.
